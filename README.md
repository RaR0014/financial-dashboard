# Portfolio Dashboard

A showcase of sample financial‐data visualizations I created using two approaches:

1. **Python & Plotly** – An end-to-end Jupyter/Colab notebook and Streamlit app for fetching, transforming, and interactively exploring stock & ETF performance.
2. **Power BI** – A polished Power BI Desktop report with DAX measures, rich interactive visuals, and live‐data demos.
